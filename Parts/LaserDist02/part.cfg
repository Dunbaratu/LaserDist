    // Note from the mod author, Steve:
    //
    //    Due to a problem I still haven't worked out, all LaserDist parts that have a nonzero
    //    value for MaxBendX or MaxBendY need the same nonzero value as each other.
    // 
    //    In other words, this would be an acceptable configuration:
    //        LaserDist100x has MaxBendX = 0
    //        LaserDist200x has MaxBendX = 0
    //        LaserDist500x has MaxBendX = 0
    //
    //    And this would be an acceptable configuration:
    //        LaserDist100x has MaxBendX = 5
    //        LaserDist200x has MaxBendX = 5
    //        LaserDist500x has MaxBendX = 5
    //
    //    And this would be an acceptable configuration:
    //        LaserDist100x has MaxBendX = 0
    //        LaserDist200x has MaxBendX = 15 
    //        LaserDist500x has MaxBendX = 15
    //
    //    And this would be an acceptable configuration:
    //        LaserDist100x has MaxBendX = 0
    //        LaserDist200x has MaxBendX = 0
    //        LaserDist500x has MaxBendX = 20
    //
    //    But if you try to do something like this, it won't work:
    //        LaserDist100x has MaxBendX = 0
    //        LaserDist200x has MaxBendX = 50
    //        LaserDist500x has MaxBendX = 15
    //    Because there are two unequal nonzero values present among the set.
    //
    //    Why?
    //    ----
    //    There is something about the floating slider widget in the context menus that can't seem
    //    to handle having two different LaserDist instances with different min/max values as each
    //    other. It's behaving as if it's a static member - only one universal value for the whole class.
    //    When you edit the value for one instance at runtime, it seems to change for all the other
    //    ones too.
    //
    //    Until I solve that problem, for now all LaserDist parts will have to adhere to that rule
    //    described above.
    // 
    //
    // This part can deflect the laser beam horizontally, but not vertically:
