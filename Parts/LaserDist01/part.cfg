  description = A long-distance Laser!  Wow!  that probably blows stuff up right?  Well, no.  It just measures things.  Specifically this laser measures distances to the ground, along whichever line it happens to be pointed, which is not necessarily straight down, depending on how your craft is tilted and how the Beamer 100x is mounted on the craft.  WARNING: It does tend to use a lot of electricity to run the powerful long-distance laser.  Range=100,000m
