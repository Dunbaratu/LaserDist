  description = A long-distance Laser!  Wow!  that probably blows stuff up right?  Well, no.  It just measures things.  Specifically this laser measures distances to the ground or any other object it hits, along whichever line it happens to be pointed.  WARNING: It does tend to use a lot of electricity to run the powerful long-distance laser.  Range=100,000m^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hinfinite for now.
